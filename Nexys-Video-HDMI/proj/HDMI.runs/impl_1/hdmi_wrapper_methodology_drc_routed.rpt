There is a large setup violation of -95.519 ns between hdmi_i/PhaseDetector_0/inst/PhaseDetector_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/ref_count_reg[2]/C (clocked by clk_out1_hdmi_clk_wiz_0_0) and hdmi_i/PhaseDetector_0/inst/PhaseDetector_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/phase_temp_reg[2]/D (clocked by clk_out1_hdmi_clk_wiz_0_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture

XDCB-5#1 Warning
Runtime inefficient way to find pin objects  
The option '-through : [get_pins -filter {NAME =~ */SyncAsync*/oSyncStages_reg[0]/D} -hier]' of constraint 'set_false_path' uses inefficient query to find pin objects (see constraint position '7' in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). To reduce runtime, it is recommended to get the pins through the cell objects. Please refer to Using Constraints Guide (Constraints Efficiency). An example of optimal query is: get_pins -filter {REF_PIN_NAME=~yy*} -of_objects [get_cells -hierarchical xx*].
